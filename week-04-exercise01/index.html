        <h1>My Dev Tools Vandalism</h1>
        <p>
            I used browser developer tools to temporarily "vandalize" a
            website. Below is a screenshot showing my changes. These edits
            only appeared on my computer and did not affect the actual
            website.
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot-container">
            <!-- 
                IMPORTANT: Update the src attribute below to match your screenshot filename.
                Example: If your screenshot is named "apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png", change the line to:
                src="./apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png"
            -->
            <img src="./devtools-vandalism-screenshot.png.png" alt="Screenshot of the webpage I vandalized" />
        </div>
        <h2>I "vandalized" TTU.edu</h2>
        <p>
            I changed the main page catchy phrase at the top of the home page.  The text originally said "I am a prospective student"
            After I made changes, the text read "Smile like a creepy clown". 
            I also changed the color of the text to blue from white and I changed the background color. I wanted the changes 
            to look obviously different from the web page using blue instead of red black or white.  I also wanted it to say 
            something silly and with halloween last week, I could only think of a creepy clown! While using devtools, I think 
            it is helping me have a better understanding of how HTML and CSS work together, but it does still look somewhat 
            intimidating in a good way.  I see there is so much more we can learn to design our own pages in the future and be 
            able to get very creative with it.
