                    This game was unexpectedly fun and a great way to enjoy the Indiana Jones universe from a different
                    perspective. I had zero expectations and didn't play it immediately after release, but I'm glad I
                    decided to buy it when it went on sale. Was it a perfect game? No! But was it an engaging
                    single-player experience that let me pretend I was an adventurous archaeologist? Yes! And
                    really,that's all you need from a game, right? <em>**cracks whip emphatically!**</em>
