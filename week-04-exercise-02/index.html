                <p class="description">
                    This home was Frank Lloyd Wright's personal home and studio from 1889 to 1909.  This home today
                    is preserved as a museum that is open to the public.  Wright expanded this home over the years
                    as his family grew.  Originally the home was designed in a Queen Anne style, while the additions
                    to the home and studio became a Prairie Style design, that originated by Wright.

                <p class="description">
                    Located in Oak Park, Illinois, Frank Lloyd Wright designed this home for Frank Thomas in 1901.  
                    This home is a tradition style Prairie Style home.  The rooms of the home are elevated and unique
                    to the area, this home did not have a basement.  This home has the features of Wrights designs 
                    including a low hanging roof, built in shelves and cabinets and casement windows. This home
                    is beautiful in its design of solid concrete elements connecting with nature.

                <h2>Laura Gale House</h2>
                <p class="details">FLW | 1909 | Oak Park, Illinois</p>
                <p class="description">
                    The Gale House was created during one of Wright’s most productive times working in the 
                    Prairie style. Experts in architecture see it as an important step in the early growth 
                    of modern architecture. Wright’s use of simple geometric forms in both the design details 
                    and overall structure may have influenced the modern European architects of the 1920s. 
                    Among his Oak Park, Illinois projects, the Gale House stands out as one of his most distinctive 
                    designs. It has a compact layout made of interlocking rectangular shapes built around a central 
                    fireplace. The strong rectangular forms on the outside are unlike anything else Wright designed 
                    before or after this house.

                <h2>Hills-Decaro House</h2>
                <p class="details">FLW | 1906 | Oak Park, Illinois</p>
                <p class="description">
                    Located at 313 Forest Avenue in Oak Park, Illinois, the Hills DeCaro House is a significant 
                    remodeling by Frank Lloyd Wright from 1906, transforming an 1883 Stick style Victorian home 
                    into one of his early mature Prairie style works. 
                    Wright's intervention rotated the house 90 degrees on its lot, applied a stucco and dark wood 
                    banded exterior, 
                    deep overhanging eaves, and horizontally grouped windows; all hallmarks of his Prairie style. 
                    Internally, the 
                    remodel introduced open flow spaces, built in furnishings and a strong connection between the 
                    indoors and outdoor 
                    terraces. 
                    After a devastating fire in 1976, the house was carefully reconstructed based on Wright's 
                    original drawings under 
                    the stewardship of later owners, the DeCaros, hence the combined name. Today the Hills DeCaro 
                    House stands as a 
                    landmark of early 20th century American architecture, illustrating Wright's transition from his 
                    experimental work 
                    into the full expression of the Prairie School

                <p class="details">FLW | 1985 | 1923 | Oak Park, Illinois</p>
                <p class="description">
                    Completed in 1895, this is Frank Lloyd Wright's first independent commision in Oak Park after 
                    Wright left the office of Adler and Sullivan in 1893. On December 23, 1922 a fire destroyed 
                    the third and fourth floors of the home. Wright immediately returned to Oak Park in 1923 to
                    redesign and rebuild the home for a second time.

                <h2>Frederick Robie House</h2>
                <p class="details">FLW | 1910 | Chicago, Illinois</p>
                <p class="description">
                    The Robie House, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and completed in 1910 in Chicago's Hyde Park 
                    neighborhood, stands as the quintessential example of the Prairie style of architecture. 
                    Its low profile, horizontally stretched massing, long bands of art glass windows, and deep 
                    overhanging eaves all draw inspiration from the flat Midwestern landscape. Inside, the house 
                    abandons the traditional compartmentalized rooms in favor of an open plan centered around a 
                    massive fireplace that separates living and dining spaces, allowing light to flood in through 
                    the ribbon windows. Built of Roman brick with limestone bands and supported by steel framing, 
                    the home also tucked its entrance away in a recessed court, enhancing the sense of discovery 
                    and flow. This pioneering design was a key moment in American residential architecture, 
                    signaling a shift toward modernism and harmonizing interior space, furniture, and landscape 
                    into a unified whole.
